## Multiverse OS: `framekit` CSS/HTML Only Webkit2+gtk3 UI 
**URL** [multiverse-os.org](https://multiverse-os.org)

A webkit library for building GUI interfaces, using a window controlled by GTK
and an element being rendered that is a webkit2 widget that has javascript and
java disabled for security reasons. 

In the future, webkit itself will be modified and have all the unncessary parts
cut out and vendoered in this project, and all the javascript/java rendering to
ensure that it can not be called even with the setting disabled while shrinking
the dependencies.
